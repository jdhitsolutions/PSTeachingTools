# Start-TypedDemo

## SYNOPSIS

Simulate a PowerShell console session

## SYNTAX

### Random (Default)

```yaml
Start-TypedDemo [-File] <String> [-RandomMinimum <Int32>] [-RandomMaximum <Int32>] [-Transcript <String>]
 [-NoExecute] [-NewSession] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Static

```yaml
Start-TypedDemo [-File] <String> [-Pause <Int32>] [-NoExecute] [-NewSession] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

This command simulates an interactive PowerShell session. It will process a text file of PowerShell commands. The function will insert your prompt and "type" out each command when you press any key. At the end of the typed command or whenever a pipe character is inserted, the script will pause. Press Enter or any key to continue. If it is the end of the command pressing Enter will execute the command. Use the -NoExecute parameter to run through the demo without executing any commands.

Commented lines in your demo file will be skipped.

Press 'q' or ESC at any pause to quit the demo.

This command  will NOT run properly in the PowerShell ISE. It is designed to be used in a PowerShell console session. It appears to work fine in a Windows Terminal PowerShell session.

VARIABLE NAMES
Do not use any variables in your script file that are also used in this script. These are the variables you most likely need to avoid:

 $file
 $i
 $running
 $key
 $command
 $count

MULTI-LINE COMMANDS
To use a multi-line command, in your demo file, put a :: before the first line and :: after the last line:

...
Get-Date
::
get-ciminstance win32_logicaldisk -filter "Drivetype=3" |
Select Caption,VolumeName,Size,Freespace |
format-table -autosize
::
Get-Process
...

The function will simulate a nested prompt. Press any key after the last >> to execute. Avoid using the line continuation character in your demo file.

TIMING
By default the function will insert a random pause interval between characters. This is a random value in milliseconds between the -RandomMinimum and -RandomMaximum parameters which have default values of 50 and 140 respectively. If you want a static or consistent interval, then use the -Pause parameter. The recommended value is 80.

SCOPE
All the commands in your demo script are executed in the context of the Start-TypedDemo function. This means you have to be very aware of scope. While you can access items in the global scope like PSDrives, anything you create in the demo script will not persist.

However, command history will be persisted to the history and command buffers as well as the PSReadline history file. This allows you to use the Up Arrow or the history commands to find items you ran in the demo.

COMMENTS
Any line that begins with # will be treated as a comment and skipped. If you have a multi-line comment you will need to put a # at the beginning of each line. You can't use PowerShell's block comment characters.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

```powershell
PS C:\> Start-TypedDemo c:\work\demo.txt
```

Run the commands in c:\work\demo.txt using the random defaults

### Example 2

```powershell
PS C:\> Start-TypedDemo c:\work\demo.txt -pause 100 -NoExecute
```

Run the commands in c:\work\demo.txt using a static interval of 100 milliseconds. The function will only type the commands. They will not be executed.

### Example 3

```powershell
PS C:\> Start-TypedDemo c:\work\demo.txt -transcript c:\work\demotrans.txt
```

Run the commands in c:\work\demo.txt using the random defaults and create a transcript file.

## PARAMETERS

### -File

The file name of PowerShell commands to execute. It can have any extension you choose.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Pause

The typing speed interval between characters in milliseconds. The recommended value is 100.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: Static
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: 80
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RandomMinimum

The minimum time interval between characters in milliseconds. The default is 50.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: Random
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: 50
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RandomMaximum

The maximum time interval between characters in milliseconds. The default is 140.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: Random
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: 140
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Transcript

The file name and path for a transcript session file. Existing files will be overwritten. The transcript will have a minimum header.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: Random
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NoExecute

Do not execute any of the commands.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NewSession

Simulate a new PowerShell session with the copyright header and a prompt. This works best if you start your demo from the C: drive. The header will be mocked depending on the version of PowerShell you are running. This will only work with Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters

This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see [about_CommonParameters](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### None

## OUTPUTS

### None. This only writes to the host console, not the pipeline. Although you can create a transcript.
